# Account Creator
A script which will automatically fill account information in for you and create you an account. All you have to do is captchas. Currently it operates on the Brave browser but with tweaks it can work on any browser.

# Market Notifier
Notifies a discord webhook about new market changes. It also notifies if a new client has been deployed.

# Model Export
Exports a model (OR PLACE) file to an XML file. You can tweak stuff that the BrickPlanet Workshop cannot change such as root node names ( like Workspace ).
